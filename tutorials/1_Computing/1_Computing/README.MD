# Computing 

At its broadest level, computing is defined as anything
that involves computers in some way, from designing the physical components that
make up a single device to designing massive systems like the Internet that use
computing principles.

### Programming Is Everywhere

No matter where in computing you end up going, you’ll likely be dealing with
programming in some way. Even if you’re not writing code yourself, you might be
designing programs for someone else to code, or designing the hardware which will
run code. Being able to program is like being able to speak a language. Just as you
need to speak Spanish to communicate in Spain, you need to speak “code” to com-
municate in computing.

# Programming Vocabulary

In order to talk about programming, there are some basic terms we need to know.

### Programs and Code

A **line of code** is generally a single command. Very often, we’ll talk in terms of
individual lines of code and what each line does. In practice, we’ll find a single line
could actually set off a sequence of lots of other commands, but generally a single
line of code is the smallest unit we’re interested in dealing with at this stage.

A **program**, for our purposes, is a collection of lines of code that serves one
or more overall functions. This could be anything from calculating the average of
some numbers to running a self-driving automobile. Programs are often what we’re
interested in building. A program is like a house and lines of code are like individual
bricks.

### Input and Output

Nearly every program we write is also largely defined by its relationship with its
input and its output. **Input** is anything that we put into a program for it to work
on, and output is what the program gives us in return. Usually we’re not going to
write programs that do the exact same thing every time they’re used—usually we’re
going to write programs that process input in some way, providing **output** that
corresponds to the input.

### Compiling and Executing

**Compiling** is like reading over code and looking for errors in the way we’ve
written it. It’s kind of like the proofreading you would do on an essay.
Code has more strict syntax than an essay, though, so we rely on other computer programs, called compilers, to do this for us. They read in the code
and let us know what problems they find.

**Executing** is then when the program is actually run. Just because some code
compiled into a program doesn’t mean it will actually do what we want it to do—it
just means that what we told it to do makes sense. For example, imagine we wrote a program that would add two numbers, but instead we accidentally put a subtraction
sign instead of an addition sign. The code still makes perfect sense during compila-
tion, it just does the wrong thing

## Programming Languages

In order to write an essay, you must have a language in which to write it. You could
write an essay in English, Japanese, Spanish, or Mandarin, but there must be a language. The same is true for programming: you must have a language in which to write. Just as different written languages have different syntax, different vocabular-
ies, different structures, so also do different programming languages have different syntax, different vocabulary, and different structures.

## Console vs. GUI

**Console**
An output medium for a program to show exclusively text-based output.

**Graphical User Interface**
An output medium that uses more than just text, like forms, buttons,tabs, and more. More programs are graphical user interfaces.

## Computing vs. Programming

**Programming** is indeed the foundation of computing. Learning to program is like learning to speak the language of the computer. However, learning to speak the language of the computer is only a small part of actual computing. **Computing** is about what you use that language to say. It’s oftentimes easy to focus too strongly on the programming and miss the underlying concepts and principles of computing as a whole.

### Code Segments

To demonstrate the Foundations and the Language and to apply them to the Domain, you’re going to see a lot of code segments.
